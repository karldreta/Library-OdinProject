# libraryProject-odin
Project: Library from JS path of The Odin Project


## This is an Odin Project: Library

* For now, I am expected to create a Library App, for this I will demonstrate my understanding of:

    * Arrays
    * Objects
    * Object Constructors
    * Prototypal Inheritance

* For the moment this project is only a an early draft. I am not yet expected to add any type of storage to save the information, since "I will have the option to come back to this project later on in the course".
